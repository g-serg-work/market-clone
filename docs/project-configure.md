# ðŸ”§ Project Configure

For development, the project contains 2 config:

1. Webpack - [../config/build](../config/build)
2. vite - [vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts)

Both collectors are adapted to the main features of the application.

The whole configuration is stored in [../config](../config)
